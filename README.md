# Data-visualization-with-python

I will create basic visualizations using the data taxonomy.txt 

Plot Petals, Internode, and Sepal against Fruit. 
Generate histograms for Petals, Internode, Sepal, and Fruit. Describe the distribution of each variable. 
The next graph-a boxplot of Bract against Fruit. Bin the values of Bract.
Add the new column of data to the existing dataframe. Generate a boxplot with Fruit and Bract_Cat. 
Generate a bar chart for Taxon and Fruit. Select 4 rows of data, one with Taxon of I, one with II, one with III, and one with IV. Did the same with Bract_Cat, except selected 3 rows of data.
