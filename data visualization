#The median is not centered in the box; it is placed closer to the bottom. The range of higher fruit is more numerous than the range of lower fruit.


##The 2nd group, BractII , has the largest spread, the largest standard deviation. 
#The median is not centered in the box; it is placed a bit closer to the upper part. 
#The top whisker is shorter than the bottom whisker.
#The range of higher fruit is a bit lesser numerous than the range of lower fruit.


##The 3rd group, BractIII , has the 2nd largest spread, the largest standard deviation.
#This would indicate the Bract change in this group leads to greater changes in the fruit 
#The median is not centered in the box; it is placed a bit closer to the bottom. 
#The top whisker is longer than the bottom whisker.
#The range of higher fruit is a bit more numerous than the range of lower fruit.


##The 4th group, BractIV , median is not centered in the box; it is placed a closer to the bottom.
